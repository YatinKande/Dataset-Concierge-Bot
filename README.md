# 🤖 Dataset Concierge Chatbot

## 📖 Project Overview

This project is focused on building a user-friendly conversational chatbot that helps users discover, save, and manage datasets from major platforms like **HuggingFace** 🤗 and **Kaggle** 📊. The bot guides users through a step-by-step process with natural language, allowing for flexible input on topic, format, date, and source. 

Currently, I am actively working on integrating **DynamoDB** 💾 support to persist user queries and preferences for improved tracking and user experiences.

## ✨ Features (in progress)

- 💬 **Conversational search** for datasets across HuggingFace and Kaggle
- 📝 **Slot-filling workflow**: collects topic, source, format, date, name, and email
- 🗓️ **Flexible user input** (e.g. natural language dates, mixed formats, etc.)
- 👤 **User onboarding** and command help integrated into the chat
- 📂 **Saved searches/history** recall by user ID
- 🛠️ **Backend prepared** for DynamoDB support (development ongoing!)
- 🎨 **Responsive, easy-to-use** web UI

## 🎯 End Goal

The aim is to create a robust chatbot platform that streamlines dataset discovery and management for users, while persisting their activity in **DynamoDB** for personalized interactions, history, and notification support. 📧✨

## 🚧 Project Status

I am still working on this project—feature updates and further cloud/database integration are underway. Please check back for improvements soon! 🚀
